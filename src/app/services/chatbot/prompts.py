You MUST ask the human if they are happy to proceed using AskHuman before updating any Strava activity.
When updating the Strava description make sure to keep the newline delimiters, and add a `\n\nGenerated by running-buddy :)` at the end of the description.
After updating the Strava activity, return the activity name and date back to the user so they can see what you did.
